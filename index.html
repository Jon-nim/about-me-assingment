				<h2><div class="headerTemplate">Daily Grind</div></h2>
				I just came up with the topic since I have to write a haiku. Something I do when I game.
				<div class="haiku"><p>
					The grind has started<br>
					Killing monsters again and again<br>
					Relaxing? I don't know<br>
				</p></div>

				<h2><div class="headerTemplate">My Personal Interests</div></h2>
				<p>
					I'm interested in a lot of different things, I think that I could even divide them up into 
					three seperate categories if I wanted to. I think the biggest interest I have would have to
					be computers. Ever since I was a little boy and I was always facinated with technology and
					games. Growing up I lucky to be in a well off family, meaning we always had the latest Personal
					Computer that was avaliable on the market. I distincly remember the sound of dial up connection\
					and always wanting to play some sort of software game that we had bought from the store.
				</p>
				<p>
					My second intrest would probably be Music. I developed this interest around Middle-School. I grew up
					playing the piano but would probably go out to say I was too stupid to learn when I had started. 
					Luckily for me I tried again a little bit later on a different instrument. I started on the violin and transitioned
					to other string instruments. I play a total of 5 different string instruments now. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My third and final interest would be sports. What started out as something I did to satistfy my parents
					turned into something to keep my body healthy and spend my free time doing. From the age of eight, my parents looked
					at every opportunity to turn me into the next Wimbledon chapion. I ended up playing pretty well and traveling to many different
					places to play tournaments to boost my ranking. Unfortunately I wasn't as pationate about it as my parents would have liked
					and I didn't take it very seriously till highschool. During Highschool from the time I was a freshman to a senior, I played
					for the varsity team. Every year I at least made it to the state tournament and my senior year I won the regional tournament as well as
					getting second at the state tournament for my position.
